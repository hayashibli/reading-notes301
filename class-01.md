# Responsive Web Design
Considered as building and creating a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size (ex: mobile or laptop). The difference between *Responsive* and *Adaptive* web design is that responsive means to react quickly to any change where as adaptive means to be easily modified for a new situation and a combination of them can result in a functional website. There is also another term *Mobile* which means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.
